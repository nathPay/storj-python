# storj-python binding 
### *Developed using libuplinkc v0.31.6*

## Initial Set-up

**NOTE**: for Golang

Make sure your `PATH` includes the `$GOPATH/bin` directory, so that your commands can be easily used [Refer: Install the Go Tools](https://golang.org/doc/install):
```
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

Install [storj-uplink](https://godoc.org/storj.io/storj/lib/uplink) go package, by running:
```
$ go get storj.io/storj/lib/uplink
```

**NOTE**: for Python 

Please ensure you have Python 3.x and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed on your system. If you have Python version 3.4 or later, pip is included by default. pythonStorj does not support Python 2.x.
```
$ python get-pip.py
```

Install [storjPython](https://pypi.org/project/storjPython/) python package, by running:
```
$ pip install storjPython
```

## Set-up Files

* After git cloning go package, using cmd/terminal, navigate to the ```$HOME/go/src/storj.io/storj/lib/uplinkc``` folder.

* Create '.so' file at  ```$HOME/go/src/storj.io/storj/lib/uplinkc``` folder, by using following command:
```
$ go build -o libuplinkc.so -buildmode=c-shared 
```

* Copy *libuplinkc.so* file into the folder, where Python package was installed

* To include uplinkPython in you project, import the library, by using following command:
```
from storjPython.uplinkPython import *
```
* Create an object of ```libUplinkPy``` class to access all the functions of library. Please refer the sample *HelloStorj.py* file, for example.
```
variable_name = libUplinkPy()
```

## Sample Hello Storj!

File *helloStorj.py* can be found in folder where Python package was installed.

The sample *helloStorj.py* code calls the *uplinkPython.py* file and imports the *libUplinkPy* binding class to do the following:
* list all buckets in a Storj project
* create a new bucket (if it does not exist) within desired Storj project
* write a file from local computer to the a Storj bucket
* read back the object from the Storj bucket to local system for verification
* list all objects in a bucket
* delete bucket from a Storj project
* create shareable Scope key using API key and Encryption PassPhrase
* retrieving information from shareable Scope key for storj access
* delete object from a bucket using created scope key


## Storj-Python Binding Functions

**NOTE**: Every function consists of error response. Please use it, to check if the function call was successful or not. In case, if it is not *None*, then you may also show the error's text. Please refer the sample *HelloStorj.py* file, for example.
